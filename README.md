# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). 
TinyApp allows the users to view how many total visits there were and the count of unique visitors that have visited their shortened URL. Also, the user can view when each individual visit took place on their shortened URL.
